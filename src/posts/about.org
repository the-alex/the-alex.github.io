#+TITLE: Sur Moi

* I've done a few things I'm proud of.

- Built a web application for the City of Flint to keep records of lead service line replacements, which led to published research, and the founding of [[https://www.blueconduit.com/][/BlueConduit/]].
- Part of the early engineering team at [[https://urbint.com/][Urbint]], which grew from around 20 heads to 70 during the few years I was there. What a ride.

These days I'm taking it easy, working part time, reading and learning more musical instruments and styles.
