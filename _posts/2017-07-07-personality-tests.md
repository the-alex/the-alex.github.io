I've traditionally been very cold towards personality tests and the classification schemes they encode. My hesitation comes from a fear that by giving a label to a group of people, the label begins to take the place of details about the individual's personality. With a framework for classifying personalities, you're biased towards making assumptions about the person that fit your model and away from taking what you observe at face value. It not only affects how you see yourself, but also how you see others.

> _"I'm not very assertive because I'm an X", "I'm not really that detail oriented because I'm actually more of a Y than a Z", "I've always been anxious in groups because I'm a little bit more A than B or C", "I would never trust an H or G"._

By giving someone a taxonomy of personalities, they begin to use the stereotypes of the frameworks to make claims of another's personality for which they have no real evidence to support. It's also true that by adopting or endorsing a label for yourself, you are psychologically biasing yourself to observe, reward, and penalize certain aspects of your personality within the framework. When given a template to fill in the blanks, there is a desire to see yourself and others as fitting in well.

While I still believe this fear to be well-founded, I had the realization today that I was so overwhelmingly focused on the negative potential for these frameworks that I was failing to see a strong upside. When these frameworks are accurate, they allow you to safely assume more with less information. You can learn more about the person and cater your behavior to them accordingly. Individuals who may have been predisposed to be at each other's throats by the expression of certain incompatible traits may begin to understand each other's dispositions, avoiding petty conflicts and unnecessary confrontations.

Put more rigorously, your mental model of another's personality can converge to an accurate depiction much more quickly by starting with these templated assumptions. A good personality taxonomy effectively serves as a set of good priors.

I've come to understand a new appreciation for these models. Like any other model, they are always wrong, but some are useful! This understanding alone justifies their use just as any other model, so long as they are based in empirical evidence and not just the stars in the skies or a mother's intuition.
