_This is adapted from a response to an email a friend of mine sent me, asking for my thoughts on an article that recently became popular across various subreddits and college Facebook groups I frequent. The article can be found [HERE](http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2015/12/learn-to-code-its-harder-than-you-think.html)._


After skimming the article I've gathered some preliminary thoughts. I'll definitely be refining my argument sometime either this week or definitely over winter break. I apologize for the sterile tone- I blame medication.

The author claims that because a majority of programmers are self taught, the barrier to entry must necessarily be the difficulty programming itself, as many other fields have rigorous filtering mechanisms. The author sees this as evidence that the only limiting factor to programming is ones natural talent, and further hypothesizes that the dearth of programming talent is explained by a minority of the population possessing the necessary natural ability. I believe this claim is false and short sighted, as it fails to account for the context under which these older self taught programmers entered the field and what kinds of jobs they are actually performing. The nature of programming today is quite different compared to twenty or thirty years ago when the field itself was in it's earliest commercial stages.

Programming as a field field has expanded to allow for programming jobs which are not as demanding as those present even ten years ago. Programming and Software Development refer to a broad class of jobs which require a variety of cognitive skills, untied only by the fact that an individual must write code as a frequent requirement of that job. These cognitive skills are present in everyone to certain degrees, and those with certain combinations will gravitate to different areas of programming. The author's position is that programming itself requires an aptitude for a specific set of cognitive skills, and that only those with the greatest aptitude are capable of entering the field. While this may be true in its most literal sense- that you must be able to program in order to be a programmer- the perception that most people are incapable is simultaneously naive, elitist, and unscientific.

I haven't begun to provide evidence and I regret to say that I don't have the time at the moment, but I'll leave with one citation ...


>"People believe that because expert performance is qualita- tively different from normal performance the expert performer must be endowed with characteristics qualitatively different from those of normal adults. This view has discouraged scientists from systematically examining expert performers and accounting for their performance in terms of the laws and principles of general psychology. We agree that expert performance is qualitatively different from normal performance and even that expert performers have characteristics and abilities that are qualitatively different from or at least outside the range of those of normal adults. However, we deny that these differences are immutable, that is, due to innate talent. Only a few exceptions, most notably height, are genetically prescribed. Instead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.

>Most of our scientific knowledge about improvement and change comes from laboratory studies of training and practice that lasted hours, days, and occasionally weeks and months. In addition, there is a growing body of data on the heritabilities of various abilities and characteristics estimated for twins and parents and their offspring sampled from the general population (Plomin et al., 1990). Although behavioral geneticists carefully point out that their heritability estimates are valid only for the limited range of practice and skill in the normal environment of the adults studied, it is often incorrectly assumed by lay people that these estimates can be directly extended to extreme manipulations of environmental conditions, such as extended deliberate practice. Most important, the effects of short-term training cannot be readily extended to the effects of orders of magnitude more practice." - "The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance", K. Anders Ericsson, Ralf Th. Krampe, and Clemens Tesch-Romer 1993
