_This is adapted from a response to an email a friend of mine sent me, asking for my thoughts on an article that recently became popular across various subreddits and college Facebook groups I frequent. The article can be found [HERE](http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2015/12/learn-to-code-its-harder-than-you-think.html)._

I'm a pretty fair person when it comes to argument. Rarely do I find an opinion so incendiary that my burning desire to comment overwhelms my conscious abstinence from the chorus of Internet shouting matches- however, an exception must be made. The article begins, as most blog posts should, with a handy dandy [TL;DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR).

> All the evidence shows that programming requires a high level of aptitude that only a small percentage of the population possess. The current fad for short learn-to-code courses is selling people a lie and will do nothing to help the skills shortage for professional programmers.

In the interest of spending my life doing more productive things than shaking down nerds on the Internet, I'll comment only on what I believe is the _philosophy_ of Hadlow's argument- the core set of positions which I find many reasonable people seem sympathetic to. 

I choose to do this because Hadlow appears to have done very little in the way of vetting his evidence. Indeed, the comment section has done much of that work for him, pointing out where Hadlow [overgeneralizes StackOverflow survey results](http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2015/12/learn-to-code-its-harder-than-you-think.html?showComment=1449253689584#c1443569636543852685) and [cites BS research](http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2015/12/learn-to-code-its-harder-than-you-think.html?showComment=1449248371813#c7305836036418849844).

Please correct me if you disagree, but this is the most charitable interpretation of Hadlow's argument I can muster.

1. Becoming a good programmer requires rare, innate talent.
1. Learn-to-code courses claim to teach people the skills necessary to become employable programmers.
1. Therefore, learn-to-code courses are being disingenuous at best and at worst, 'selling people a lie'.

## On 'Innate Talent'

I'd like to immediately address the idea of their being some innate talent, either passed down from the family through genes or caused by fortunate mutations. There is a study I'd like to cite here, one published in a peer reviewed journal. [_"The Role of Deliberate Practice ..."_](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.169.9712) is an article addressing exactly how "expert performers" acquire their abilities. It concludes with a paragraph that I think is sharply relevant here.

> People believe that because expert performance is qualitatively different from normal performance the expert performer must be endowed with characteristics qualitatively different from those of normal adults ... However, we deny that these differences are immutable, that is, due to innate talent ... Instead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.

The paper makes the claim that it's not the presence of talent which allows expert performance, but rather, years of carefully meditated practice. This, to me, should conform strongly to our intuitions. "To be a master, you must spend 10,000 hours on that craft". Variations of this phrase appear in specific domains as well. I've seen numerous authors quoted around this subject, advising students of writing to get their first million words down on paper because only after then will you write something worth reading. I've often heard similar sayings in the programming community with regard to the number of lines of code one must write until they are deemed competent.

Yet, I still find myself in discussions where my company takes the contrary opinion, often with reference to personal experience. "I just can't learn economics", "Calculus just doesn't make sense to me", "I've never been a great writer". I want to make it clear that I understand the sentiment- the feelings at play in discussions where one is inclined to say this about themselves, as I am guilty of such proclamations as well. However, I've come to understand a principle about myself that I have attempted to generalize to others. Fair warning, this is where I leave the domain of science and get comfy in my psycho-philosophical armchair, but I believe that these vocalizations are rooted in a failure to be honest with one's goals and desires.

## Talking from the Psycho-Philosophical Armchair

When in the presence of experts, there's a desire to back away from any claims on one's own ability in their domain. Concessions like the hypothetical lot above are most common in the presence of experts in the subject of discussion. In part because we might want to compliment the expert on their achievement in an area we find challenging, but also to excuse ourselves of any failed aptitude for the subject. The concession is an attempt to absolve ourselves of any crimes against the subject area. We assert that it isn't the subject's fault- the subject isn't dumb- but rather that we are incapable.

To an extent, this is fine. The heart is in the right place. What is wrong, in my mind, is to believe that you were unable to pursue the topic more due to a false requirement of innate talent. It's the difference between _can't_ and _won't_. The reason you didn't learn economics wasn't because you couldn't, it was because _you didn't want to, but that's okay_. The greater issue that needs to be addressed is the factor which perpetuates this set of beliefs about innate talent. The embarrassment people seem to feel over not pursuing a subject. It is the feeling that, to the expert, the subject is trivial and that we might be judged for not having greater ability in that area.

No one should be held at fault or blamed in some way for not pursuing one craft or another. I am constantly amazed by my peers in other domains. Not just by their abilities, but by their ability to take any subject in their domain and convince me of the value in their passion. As I'm sure the reader will agree, the most impressive individuals are those which make you reconsider your path- those who are so passionate that you are momentarily convinced that you should devote yourself to their craft as well. In reality, there should be no jealousy, but appreciation for human dedication. Indeed, I find the idea that there can be so many disciplines with active, passionate communities is a testament to the breadth and ability of the human mind, rather than evidence for seemingly random individually assigned limitations.

## So why don't we have more programmers?

So my position on Hadlow's argument is merely a permutation on of greater position that I hold: It's not that one can't code, but rather that they don't want to, and we may ask ourselves, 'why is this the case?'. Well, certainly it's difficult. I'll grant Hadlow that. But math is also hard. So is writing. There's even a phrase 'anything worth doing is hard'. So why is it that programing gets singled out?

Personally, I find _'stigma'_ a convincing answer. While there's certainly still social stigma that exists, especially with women in STEM, nerds just aren't getting harassed like they used to. My belief is that the nerd-shaming mentality is on its way out of the mainstream culture, and that efforts like the "Hour of Code" and Codecademy are leading the way to giving everyone a fair chance to explore, not just programming, but many other subject areas like those in STEM.

We're seeing evidence of this shift in public opinion. Movies are being made dramatizing technology startups, Computer Science is the top major for undergraduate women at Stanford, hell, Obama's even written a few lines of javascript. It would be a disservice to ignore the role 'learn-to-code' organizations have had in this shift, and an even broader disservice to the coming generations to shame anything which promotes interest in _any_ meaningful pursuit.
