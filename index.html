</p><p><span><span>I worked under professors at the University of Michigan, analyzing the Flint Water Crisis through public survey programs managed by the <em>Flint Fast Start</em> team.

</p><p><span>I was an early member of the engineering team at <a href="https://urbint.com/"><em>Urbint</em></a>, which grew substantially during the few years I was there. We applied machine learning methods to problems in utility infrastructure.

</p><p><span>I am currently bootstrapping engineering at <a href="https://www.blueconduit.com/"><em>BlueConduit</em></a>, building the initial infrastructure to automate core data science and machine learning processes. If you are interested in building an equitable firm with a strong social mission, please make contact. We're always looking for good people.
