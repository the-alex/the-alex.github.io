... always have been, and I plan on keeping it that way. I'm currently working on my undergraduate degree at the University of Michigan. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in anything else they'll allow me to.

I'm the Communications Chair of the Michigan Data Science Team [(MDST)](mdst.eecs.umich.edu), as well as a board member of the Michigan Student Artificial Intelligence Lab [(MSAIL)](msail.org), both of which were founded in Fall 2015.

I'm primarily interested in machine learning and statistical analysis, but since my original plan was to go into full stack web development, so I'm currently much better at [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) than [MCMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo), but I'm still learning.

If you're still reading this, then you may be disappointed to know that this is where my writing stops.
