... always have been, and I plan on keeping it that way. I'm currently working
on my undergraduate degree at the University of Michigan. I am majoring in
Computer Science and minoring in anything else they'll allow me to.

I'm the Communications Chair of the Michigan Data Science Team
[(MDST)](midas.umich.edu/mdst), a club which competes in data science
prediction challenges and performs pro-bono data anlysis for good causes. As
a completely volunteer organization, we have worked with the Cities of Flint
and Detroit with municipal data projects and the University Musical Society
with their raw ticket sales data, through which we have published several
papers.

In the past, I have been a board member of [MSAIL](msail.org), organizing
weekly academic reading group meetings on everything from backpropagation to
monte carlo methods.

I am also an Instructor's Assistant (TA) for [EECS 398: Computing for Computer
Scientists](c4cs.github.io), a course which aimes to take recent undergraduates
in computer science and turn them into command line wizards.

My Erdős number is 4, thanks to Jacob Abernethy (and his colleague Manfred K.
Warmuth, and his colleague Shlomo Moran, and of course, Paul Erdős).

Here's my [resume]({{ site.url  }}/assets/resume/thealex-resume.pdf)!
