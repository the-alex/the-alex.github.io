* Many people believe you are born with traits that determine your outcome in life.
    - This is true for obvious physical traits.
        + Man / Woman
        + Athletic Build is a thing.
        + If you're colorblind you empirically can't function as well as someone who is identical in all ways, but isn't colorblind.
    - Many people generalize this too far.
        + You are not born with an aptitude for economics or a way with words.
    - The most telling factor of someone's ability at a task is how much they have analyzed and reflected on that task.
    - In other words, we do not live in a world where the average human is "born good" at any mental task.
    - The reality is that our abilities are shaped more by our values and experiences than our genes.
        + There is both anecdotal evidence for this as well as scientific research.
    - Objections
        + Well, why is it that I'm really good at this set of things and not another set of things?
            - Is it the case that you are bad at set of activities A because you aren't naturally good at them, or because you haven't practiced? Additionally, is it the case that you are bad at A because you don't enjoy A, or do you not enjoy A because you aren't good at A? In the former case, consider your values. In the later, consider you practice with the activities.
            - There is a lot of anecdotal evidence in this domain. Not much scientific.
        + I practiced set of activities A and I'm not any better at it!
            * There are many plausible explanations! Don't give up hope! There is a lot of evidence that certain types of practice are more efficient or necessary than others. Try and identify the underlying concepts or component parts to the task and practice those explicitly. Take advantage of prior research. (ie. learn about limits and R-Sums before derivatives)
